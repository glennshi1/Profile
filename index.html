<h1>Personal information</h1>
<img src="selfiepic.jpeg" alt="A Picture of Me" width ="250" style="float:right;">
<p>Hi, my name is Glenn, and I am a 21-year-old who is living in Melbourne. I have completed Year 12 high school and am currently progressing towards a bachelor’s degree. While both of my parents come from China, I was born in Perth, Western Australia. Fortunately for me, this allowed me to become a native speaker in English as well as have a good understanding of Mandarin. Although I have also learnt Japanese and Korean for some years in school, my knowledge of these languages is still beginner to intermediate. On a side note, I enjoy watching various videos and shows on YouTube and Netflix and to feed my pet dog Arrow food scraps from meals.</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>When I was young, I was always keen and enthusiastic to be able to use the computer, which back then we had to share. Once my turn came around, I would jump on the computer and play video games. One event that comes to mind is the time we bought the Xbox 360 which had Kinect body movement recognition, and I would jump, dance and play games in front of the TV. These childhood experiences sparked my interest in all things IT related, and I have been invested ever since.</p>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT so that I can receive a great education with capable teachers and tutors, and because it is one of the leading universities in Information Technology. The online study aspect of the Open Universities Australia program was also a key reason for me choosing RMIT. Eventually what I would hope to have is my own career in IT and I believe that studying at RMIT, through OUA, is a good step that will help me work towards this goal.</p>
<p>In my time studying this course, I expect to learn a solid foundation knowledge of IT. Introduction to Information Technology would expectantly provide me with a broad range of introductory IT concepts such as software, ideas, applications and job skills. Also, the ability to work in a team environment with effectiveness and creativity and being able to present projects in a professional manner.</p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<h2>Software Engineer in Test</h2>

<a href="https://ea.gr8people.com/jobs/164835/software-engineer-in-test?geo_location=ChIJ90260rVG1moRkM2MIXVWBAQ">Software Engineer in Test at Electronic Arts</a>
<h3>Job Description</h3>
<p>This position, Software Engineer in Test, often shortened to SET, is sort of like a software developer who develops software for testing. They build tools, frameworks and automated tests which can be used to run tests rapidly and repeatedly. Due to the nature of the SET role, in recent years they have largely replaced the traditional manual testing role (such as QA), although there is always some manual testing needed for problems that a human can catch more easily than a test script. This position is particularly appealing to me since I would like to have a career somewhere in game development and because it is in the Melbourne city centre.</p>

<h3>Key Skills</h3>
<p>**LIST OF SKILLS**</p>

<h3>Skills I Have</h3>
<p>At this moment I currently have some experience with the languages Java and C#. I have recently had basic experience with a version control tool, Git although not with a team. I also understand an agile software development process, having previously gone through it during a school project. Altogether there are still quite a few key skills that I am still lacking for this position.</p>

<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
<p>I would need to expand my knowledge of programming and scripting languages, as well as knowledge of the software development processes, which I can try to learn over the course of my period at RMIT. I can try to obtain the capabilities to work with teams across many locations, use version control tools with a team and work in an Agile/Scrum environment, by having the right work experience in the future. Eventually as I acquire this work experience, I can become more familiar with automation technology, frameworks, tests and game engines.</p>

<h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
<p>Although it is interesting to look at my results from the various tests, it is important to keep in mind they should not be taken too critically. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test was possibly the most in depth, or at least it certainly asked the most questions. I liked that the result had a comprehensive explanation for my personality ‘type’, and it felt the most relatable. The learning styles test result did not quite seem to fit me, as for many of the questions there were not any answers that I would normally choose, and I would simply pick the one that was closest. The Big Five Personalities test did not have as much of a detailed explanation for their results which did make it a little hard to fully understand the result’s significance.</p>

<h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
<p>The results of these tests may influence my behaviour in a team by making me more aware of my capabilities and personality traits, and be more supportive, reliable and hardworking. It might impact my behaviour by making me support my team members and as I try to move towards a frictionless environment, striving to avoid conflict. It could also influence my reliability as I try to make sure not to miss anything that needs to be done, as well as meet my own standards with good, hard work.</p>

<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
<p>When forming a team something to consider is that my tendency to support and aversion to conflict can be taken advantage of by another member of the team, who may constantly ask for help when they do not feel like working hard. This, along with a sense of self-duty can combine to create a situation where I become overloaded. Another possibility to take into consideration is that my behaviour could help create a supportive environment and a close-knit team, where team members can have confidence in each other’s dependability.</p>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>My project idea is to develop a game using Unity. The project will be a platform type game (or platformer) and keeping into consideration that a complete game could take an extraordinary amount of time and effort which would be unfeasible, the project will aim to produce a demo version. In addition, the experience using a game engine like Unity and creating a game with it could also help me develop some of the skills and knowledge required to make me qualified for my ideal position as a Software Engineer in Test.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>This project will realistically aim to be interesting and entertaining for the user, whomever it may be. That being said, a possible future revision could see it entering the gaming market, one of the fastest growing sectors of present. The global gaming market was valued at USD 162.32 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach a value of USD 295.63 billion by 2026. While there is a massive market for gaming, it is also highly competitive and dominated by big names and companies.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The project will be a platform action, side scroller game. The overall setting and theme of the game and its elements will be based on a story; however, the story will have little importance in the actual gameplay which will be the primary focus. As this is my first time creating such a project, there will almost certainly be some alterations and changes to some of the described features and components at a future date.</p>
<p>The main objective for the player will be to progress, moving across from left to right, where there will be an end goal. The player will have to move and jump across platforms and figure out their way past obstacles and enemies. The player will have movement such as left, right, and jump. Movement will come from arrow key inputs from the user. The player will also have an attack function to use against enemies which will likely come from the spacebar key.</p>
<p>There will be sound effects in the game, based on certain actions, events and interactions with the environment. The game will if possible, also include an original soundtrack or OST, although since I have no experience creating music this will most likely require the skillset of another person. The game will likewise have objects, sprites and backgrounds which will preferably be original. Once again as creating art and drawing whether on computer or hand drawn, is not one of my talents, this will most likely require the skills of another person. Having original art and music will be crucial in making the game as unique as possible, considering that there are an endless number of games already published.</p>
<p>The game will be made for PC, although there could be a possible mobile version made later. Eventually the game will be released through Steam, a video game digital distribution service where it can reach a wide audience and be distributed globally.</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>In order to develop the project, the essential hardware required is a PC and the relevant external components, such as a monitor, mouse, keyboard, etc. Otherwise, a decent laptop or something similar that can run the required software can be used. Required software include Unity, or possibly another game engine such as Unreal, a digital audio workstation such as Studio One, and a digital art software like Adobe Photoshop. Access to the internet and being able to communicate with other people working on the project is also essential.</p>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>Project management would be important to lead the work of the team, to keep us on track and to meet our goals within the time limits. Experience creating a game with a game engine and having the essentials of programming will be an important skill for this project. Knowing these will make the majority of developing the game much easier. The project also requires the knowledge and skills of creating art using a digital art software. In addition, having the ability to use a digital audio workstation (DAW) and being able to create audio and soundtracks will be a necessary requirement for the project. Acquiring the skills and skillsets required should be reasonably possible.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The project’s goal to provide entertainment and enjoyment for the user. Although not outside the realms of possibility, selling and making profit is not a core aim. If the user enjoys playing the game that this project produces, then it can be considered successful. This project’s main impact will be on the team behind it and the developers, who will expectantly have furthered their understanding of game development, programming, using various software and IT.</p>
